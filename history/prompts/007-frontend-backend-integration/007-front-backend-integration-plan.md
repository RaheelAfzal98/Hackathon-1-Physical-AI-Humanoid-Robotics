# Frontend-Backend RAG Integration Plan

## Summary

Implemented comprehensive planning for integrating the RAG backend with the frontend and enabling end-to-end local communication. This includes defining the technical architecture, data models, API contracts, and implementation approach for connecting a Docusaurus-based documentation frontend with a FastAPI-based agent backend.

## Changes Made

- Created detailed implementation plan with technical context and constitutional checks
- Developed comprehensive research document covering frontend-backend communication protocols
- Designed data models for QueryRequest, AgentResponse, SourceReference, and AgentSession
- Established API contract specifications with detailed endpoint definitions
- Created quickstart guide for easy onboarding of developers
- Updated agent context with new technology stack information

## Validation

- All required artifacts generated (plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, api_contracts.md)
- Constitutional requirements met with proper checks and balances
- Technical approach validated for compliance with specified constraints
- Architecture designed to be extensible for future enhancements
- Proper metadata handling implemented for source references and citations
