# Specification Quality Checklist: Module 2 - Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-11
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](./spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - The specification focuses on concepts rather than specific implementation details
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs - The specification addresses what students and developers need to learn about Digital Twins
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders - The language is accessible to students and developers learning the concepts
- [X] All mandatory sections completed - All required sections are present in the specification

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain - All requirements are clearly defined without needing clarification
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - Each functional requirement can be verified through specific examples and demonstrations
- [X] Success criteria are measurable - The success criteria include specific, measurable outcomes like "clearly explains", "demonstrates", "shows", etc.
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - The success criteria focus on educational outcomes rather than specific technologies
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined - Three user scenarios are clearly defined with specific steps
- [X] Edge cases are identified - Risks section identifies potential challenges students may face
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded - The specification clearly states what is and isn't included in the module
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Dependencies on Module 1 and project constitution principles are identified, along with key assumptions

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Each functional requirement has specific, verifiable outcomes
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows - The three user scenarios cover the main learning objectives of the module
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria - The specification directly addresses all success criteria listed
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification - The specification maintains a conceptual focus without diving into code or specific implementation details

## Notes

- All items have been validated and marked as complete
- The specification is ready for planning phase
